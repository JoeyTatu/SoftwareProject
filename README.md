# Project description:
Creating a semantic web site that manages appointments for tattoo artists, body piercers, body modifiers and their customers. There will be two types of accounts; artists and clients. Personalisation for the client will also be implemented, to encourage bookings. Clients will be able to rate and comment on the tattoo artistâ€™s page. Optimisation techniques will be accounted for to ensure the website is always running. Automated appointments will also be generated.  This will be implemented using Artificial Intelligence. Java, HTML, JavaScript, Java, CSS and SQLite. Ruby on Rails is the main framework for this project.

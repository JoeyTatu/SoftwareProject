A semantic web and business process automation website is to be developed.

It will be designed for the likes of tattoo artists, body piercers and body modifiers (i.e. the "artist").

The website will be able to identify, create and execute services that relate to the artist and customer.

These services relate to appointments, payments, paying taxes with the Revenue Commission.

An area of the website will also be able to rate the tattoo shops and the individual artists to assist in the customer's confidence.

The Project will begin in late September.
